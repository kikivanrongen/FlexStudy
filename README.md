# FlexStudy

## Purpose
This app contains information regarding all study (UBA) locations of the University of Amsterdam. It allows students to check-in and check-out
at a specific study location, track their study progression and locate friends at (other) UBA locations. The app is closely integrated with an online
database (Firebase) so that availability of study places is constantly tracked and updated.
