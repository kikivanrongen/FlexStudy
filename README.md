# FlexStudy

## Problem statement
Students often come across the problem that they want to study in the university library, but don’t know if the place they want to go 
to actually has available seats. Universities have many buildings suitable for studying, some of which students have never heard of. The spread of students over multiple study locations in Amsterdam can be better organised.

## Solution
The app ‘FlexStudy’ is a platform where students can check-in whenever they are at a seat in one of the university libraries.
The app will then update the number of seats available in that building. Via a google maps visualization students will be able to have 
a quick overview of the availability of study places in all the locations of the University of Amsterdam. When students leave their seat,
they check-out and the app will enable the seat for the next student.
